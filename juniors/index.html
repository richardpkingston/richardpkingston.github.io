                    <h5> Version 1 Government Roadmap Step 1B | March 2021</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <h5>Key Messages</h5>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;">
                        <li>This guidance is for organised cricket in England at Step 1B of the UK Government Roadmap out of Lockdown from 29 March 2021 until
                            further notice.
                        </li>
                        <li>This guidance will be updated at Step 2 of the UK Government Roadmap out of Lockdown (no earlier than 12 April 2021).</li>
                        <li>Clubs and venues are required to carry out a COVID Risk Assessment and to put in place control measures to limit the transmission of
                            COVID-19 during organised cricket.
                        </li>
                        <li>This guidance provides both playing and venue (staging) advice on how to control and minimise those risks whilst enjoying cricket
                            safely.
                        </li>
                        <li>Everyone attending an organised cricket activity should carry out a self-assessment for COVID symptoms before leaving home and
                            follow NHS and PHE self-isolation procedures if they are symptomatic.
                        </li>
                        <li>No one who is required to self-isolate should attend an organised cricket activity.</li>
                        <li>Cricket is by nature a socially distanced game and social distancing should be maintained on the field wherever possible.</li>
                        <li>Off the field, social distancing guidelines and legal gathering size limits must be observed – at Step 1B this means the Rule of 6
                            or a group made up of two households (a group made up of two households can include more than 6 people, but only where all members
                            of the group are from the same two households (or support/childcare bubbles, where eligible)).
                        </li>
                        <li>Changing rooms must remain closed except for disabled persons and emergency requirements. Participants should arrive in their kit
                            ready to play and should return home in their kit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Clubhouses including social and hospitality facilities must remain closed, but toilet and hand washing provision is permitted
                            subject to risk assessment, occupancy limits, suitable ventilation and frequent and effective cleaning.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hygiene breaks in play are required every 6 overs.</li>
                        <li>Participants should bring their own food and drink and drinks bottles should not be shared.</li>
                        <li>There is a legal requirement to record participant and attendee contact details for the purposes of NHS Test and Trace and clubs and
                            venues must ensure that data is collected in accordance with data protection law.
                        </li>
                        <li>Spectators are not permitted in any indoor or outdoor sport facility at Step 1B. This does not apply to carers for people with
                            disabilities, or adults needed to supervise under-18s in a safeguarding role. Where it is necessary for them to be present,
                            supervising adults should not mix with others from outside their household or support bubble.
                        </li>
